## 🧠 Mindset
+ I **HATE** disorder. I like to keep things organized, in terms of programming this means commenting code, using spaces where necessary and using a proper naming convention.
+ I am **LAZY**, but in a good way, I don't like to waste lots of time writing bad code, so instead I try to find the most optimized way to reach a solution and I won't stop on the first thing I find.
+ I make sure that when I start a project I have a **PLAN** in mind, else I go nowhere - for this mindmapping and drawing helps me A LOT.
+ I want to have everything **UNDER CONTROL** - therefore I usually start projects from scratch, unless it's something unnecessary and easy.
+ Due to the things said above, plus my maniacal way of checking for spelling mistakes, things being in alphabetical - or at least in logical - order and everything being the way I like, I tend to take a little more time than usual to reach the end result I am the most satisfied with.

P.S. I love my friends, I think everybody should find people with similar interests to make their days brighter, I will plug some of their GitHub profiles here in the future.
